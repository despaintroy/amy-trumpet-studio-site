            Amy DeSpain began the exciting journey of learning the trumpet at the age of 12 when she quickly fell in
            love with the instrument. She is now a junior at Utah State University, where she studies with Max Matzen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amy is a regular performer with the university's wind ensemble, Caine Brass Quintet, USU’s Symphony
            Orchestra, and the American Festival Orchestra. In 2018, Amy participated in a trumpet ensemble that
            performed for the International Trumpet Guild in San Antonio, Texas. In 2022 Amy participated and won USU’s
            concerto competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            When she is not playing the trumpet, you can find Amy making delicious creations in
            the kitchen, going for long runs in the sun, or beating her husband in a board game.
        </p>

        <p>I offer private trumpet and piano lessons for $20 per half-hour lesson.</p>
