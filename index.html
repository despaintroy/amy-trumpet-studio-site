            <img src="img/amy-play-bw.jpg" alt="Amy playing a trumpet solo in band"
                class="inline-image inline-image-left" style="width: 250px;">
            Amy DeSpain began the exciting journey of learning the trumpet at the age of 12 when she quickly fell in
            love with the instrument. She is currently studying music education at Utah State University with Dr. Max
            Matzen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amy is a regular performer with the American Festival Orchestra, the University's Wind Ensemble, the Caine
            Brass Quintet, and USU's Symphony Orchestra. In 2018, Amy participated in a trumpet ensemble that
            performed for the International Trumpet Guild in San Antonio, Texas. In 2022 Amy participated and won USU's
            concerto competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            When she is not playing the trumpet, you can find Amy making delicious creations in
            the kitchen, going for long runs in the sun, or defeating her husband in a board game.
